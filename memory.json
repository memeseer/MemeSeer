Expect to see humorous takes on the idea of waiting for the next big rally, perhaps featuring popular characters or figures from pop culture, emphasizing the absurdity of the endless wait. \n\nAdditionally, memes could play with the notion of FOMO (fear of missing out) versus FUD (fear, uncertainty, doubt), showcasing the dichotomy of emotions experienced by crypto enthusiasts in such a stagnant environment. Creators might also lean into self-referential humor, poking fun at the cyclical nature of crypto trends and the community's tendency to hype up the smallest changes. Ultimately, the memes will likely serve as a coping mechanism, fostering camaraderie among holders while humorously acknowledging the uncertainty that defines the crypto landscape.",
